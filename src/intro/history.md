# History
Before we get started, I think it's important we highlight the loose history of the proposal. This will make it easier for new people to get indoctrinated into the conversation we've had thus far.

For those unfamiliar with Application Binary Interfaces, please read [the FAQ](intro/what_is_an_ABI.html).

## Pre IRLO discussion
So far, there have been three primary stages in the history of this proposal. The idea for a stable ABI arose in a discussion in the Rust User's forum about programming languages that pair well with Rust. Inevitably, the discussion of FFIs arose, which lead to an constructive debate about Rust's ABI, from which arose the [initial proposal](/intro/initial_proposal.html),
