May people and organizations have spent significant effort over the years
developing ABIs.  This page is a list of useful references and resources that
show what others have done that may be useful to the project.

- [_Linkers and Loaders_](https://linker.iecc.com/) by John R. Levine.  Explains
  what linkers and loaders do, touching on ABIs and object file formats.
  Copyrighted in 2000, so some of the information on object formats is a little
  old, but the basic ideas and issues haven't changed too much, so a good place
  to start.
