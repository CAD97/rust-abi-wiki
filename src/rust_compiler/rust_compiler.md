Now that we've gotten a solid idea about what ABI is, and how it functions, let's talk about Rust. Specifically Rust's compiler. Rust's binaries *do* have an ABI - but what does that ABI look like? Where is it determined? What's preventing it from being stable?

These are some questions we hope to answer in the following chapters.
